              We use your username to identify your account so that your likes,
              follows, and views are sent to the right account. When you put in
              your username, we have no access to your accounts beyond what a
              fellow Instagram user does. Your profile photo, bio, follower
              count, and following will be visible if you are going for follows.
              For the likes service, your posts will also be visible. Then, you
              will be able to choose multiple posts across which your likes will
              be spread. This is also the same for views. You will be able to
              see your stories, reels, and video posts to choose where the views
              should be sent. Ensuring that we do not have more access to our
              account than is required to do our job is a way of keeping your
              account safe.
